Augmented Reality for Guidance:
--------------------------------

  Technology has evolved at a far superior pace that most people can grasp the changes/advances. With the advent of Augmented Reality (AR), circulating information and educating users has become easier. Many people outside of the tech-bubble are unaware of the many ways AR can be useful. Some basic applications are education, advertisement, gaming/entertainment. 
  This application demonstrates that AR can be used to show instruction videos of any product that's adopted widely by consumers. This application can be developed at a commercial scale with all possible product iamges linked with their respective instruction video manuals, serving as an aid to people unaware of the products use.
  This way, they can just point their phone camera's towards the product and see the guidelines on the product which is very useful as they won't have to go back and forth from the manual and product to fix/debug.
  AR would create a computer generated artificial overlay over the physical product and "augment" the users experience by providing more useful information on their phone screens.
  
  The application includes three separate files which perform the same computations, but generate different outputs based on the users requirements. Guidlines to use each file are included as comments.
  
 Files included:
 1. README.m - Run this file in MATLAB to invoke entire project
 2. main.m - Demo/Breakdown of each step to visualize different pre-processing steps
 3. liveAR.m - Uses a camera live feed to find a reference object, and replaces that object with target video
 4. generateVideo.m - Saves the above live feed into a video file (.mp4)
